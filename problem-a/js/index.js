/* Your code goes here! */

//Create a variable `h1` that refers to the `<h1>` element in the DOM.


//Change the `textContent` of the `<h1>` element to be "Which Swatch?"


//Somehow the rainbow icon image was included without an alt tag! Set its `alt`
//attribute to be "A beautiful rainbow".


//Give the image the Bootstrap-provided `float-right` CSS class to make it float
//to the right of the screen


//The icon requires attribution, which is included in the footer. Wrap this
//attribution (the entire contents of the footer) inside a `<small>` element,
//So that the footer should contain a `<small>` element which contains the 
//current content.
//Be careful to preserve the HTML!


//Define a function `createColorBox()` that takes in two parameters: a color 
//string and a numeric size. The function should return a _new_ `<div>` element 
//that is a colored box with the following details:
// - has a CSS class of `d-inline-block`
// - has a CSS inline style `background-color` that is the given color
// - has CSS inline style `width` and `height` properties that are both the 
//   passed in size (in `px`)
//You can test this function by logging out the returned value.



//Define a function `renderPalette()` that takes in an array of color strings
//and a "parent" DOM element. The function should add a row of colored boxes to the 
//parent element, one for each color (each created with `createColorBox()`).
//The boxes should be each take up an equal portion of their containing element
//(e.g., a palette with 3 colors will have each box take up 1/3 of the parent); 
//call the `getBoundingClientRect()` method on the parent to get an object with
//the parent's size values.
//
//You can test the function by calling it and passing it one of the `COLORS_9`
//palettes and a reference to the the <main> element.
//The palette will not resize with the browser window unless you refresh.
//
//Note that you should NOT include this test call for the tester!



//Define a function `renderPaletteTable()` that will render a color palette row
//for each of the palettes in the `COLORS_9` object into the <main> element.
//This function should _call_ your `renderPalette()` function as a helper.
//(Note that you may have to modify the `renderPalette()` method to make sure
//each palette is in its own row (hint: put the boxes in a <div>!))
//
//Call your `renderPaletteTable()` method to show all the color palettes.



//Finally, remove the paragraph that explains how to complete the problem



//Make functions and variables available to tester. DO NOT MODIFY THIS.
